I am a Master's student at the School of Mathematical Sciences, [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Wenbin Huang](http://im.pku.edu.cn/szll/xxzzyxxsjyjs/hwb/index.htm).

Prior to this, I obtained a BSc degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from the School of Mathematical Sciences, [Dalian University of Technology](https://www.dlut.edu.cn/).

My current research focuses on **LLM Reinforcement Learning (Reasoning)** and **Self-Evolving Agents**. If you are interested in these areas, please feel free to reach out for discussion or collaboration via my student email.

Beyond my research, I am a huge fan of basketball, fitness, and singing. I am always open to making new friends and sharing experiences, whether in academic research or life hobbies!
